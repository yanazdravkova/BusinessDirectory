# BusinessDirectory

This Repo contains a simple Business Directory Angular app.

**Prerequisite:**  
 Node.js  
 npm package manager (which is usually installed as part of the Node.js installation).  
 Once these are installed & you have cloned the project and opened it, run *npm install* in the vs code terminall so all the required packages are installed.  
 To start the app run *ng serve --open*

For the styling of the app Angular Material is used as well as Angular Flex Layout.
NGRX is used for the state management and I used [this tutorial](https://www.joshmorony.com/using-ngrx-effects-for-data-loading-in-an-ionic-angular-application/) for the purpose.

Possible improvements:
- Add unit tests
- Improve state management
